# AI-Chatbot

This project is designed to create an interactive chatbot using Rasa,
integrated with a MySQL database for user authentication. 
The chatbot provides various functionalities, including:

- Greeting users
- Understanding their moods
- Responding to queries

Additionally, the project includes a visualization component
to illustrate the flow of conversation using D3.js and Dagre-D3 libraries.

## Features

### Chatbot Functionality:
- Handles various user intents, such as greetings, mood tracking, and service inquiries.
- Provides tailored responses based on user input, including positive and negative feedback paths.

### Database Integration:
- User authentication is facilitated through a MySQL database.
- Secure password handling using `getpass` to ensure user credentials are not exposed.

### Visualization:
- An HTML page visualizes the Rasa Core conversation flow.
- Uses D3.js and Dagre-D3 for interactive and dynamic graph rendering.

## Usage

- Interact with the chatbot through the command line or a connected frontend interface.
- Utilize the visual representation to understand the flow of conversations and actions taken by the bot.
