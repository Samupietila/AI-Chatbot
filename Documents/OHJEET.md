# 1. **Project Overview**
Provide an introduction to your project, including its purpose, goals, and scope. Describe the problem you're solving and how your software addresses it.

### Example:
- **Project Name**: My Cool Web Application
- **Description**: A web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks and increase productivity.
- **Goals**: Simplify task management through an intuitive user interface.
- **Scope**: This project includes user registration, task creation, due dates, and notifications.

---

# 2. **System Architecture**
Describe the overall architecture of the system, including key components and how they interact. Include any software tools, platforms, or frameworks used.

### Example:
- **Architecture Type**: Client-Server architecture with RESTful API
- **Components**:
  - Frontend: React.js for the user interface.
  - Backend: Node.js with Express for server-side logic.
  - Database: MongoDB for data storage.
- **External Services**: Firebase for authentication.

### Diagram:
Include a diagram (e.g., a flowchart or UML diagram) that illustrates how the system components interact.

---

# 3. **Technologies Used**
List all the technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and tools used in the project. 

### Example:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
-  **CI/CD**: Jenkins
-  **Virtual Environment**: Docker, VM

---

# 4. **Software Design**
Provide detailed descriptions of the system's design, including major classes, functions, and algorithms. Describe the rationale behind design choices.

### Example:
- **User Authentication Flow**: Users can log in using Google Authentication through Firebase. On successful login, a token is generated, which is used for secure access to user-specific data.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in MongoDB with fields for title, description, due date, and status.

---

# 5. **Database Schema**
Explain the database structure, including tables/collections, fields, and relationships between data.

### Example:
- **Users Collection**:
  - `_id` (ObjectId)
  - `name` (String)
  - `email` (String, unique)
  - `password` (String)
- **Tasks Collection**:
  - `_id` (ObjectId)
  - `user_id` (ObjectId, reference to Users collection)
  - `title` (String)
  - `description` (String)
  - `due_date` (Date)
  - `status` (String: "pending", "completed")

---

# 6. **API Documentation**
Document the API endpoints provided by the backend. Include method types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), endpoint descriptions, parameters, and responses.

### Example:

#### **POST /api/users/login**
- **Description**: Log in a user using their email and password.
- **Request Body**:
```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }
````
- **Response: **
````json
{
  "status": "success",
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
````
- **Status Codes**
  - 200: Success
  - 400: Invalid input
  - 401: Unauthorized

# 7. **Testing Strategy**
Describe the testing approach for the project, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing. Explain the tools and frameworks used for testing.

**Example:**
  - Unit Testing: Jest for testing individual functions and components.
  - Coverage Testing
  - Integration Testing: Postman for testing API endpoints.
  - User Acceptance Testing: Manual testing by project team members and feedback from real users.
    
# 8. **Deployment Process**
Explain the steps required to deploy the software to a production environment, including setting up servers, databases, and any third-party services.

**Example:**
  - Step 1: Push code to GitHub.
  - Step 2: Deploy frontend to Netlify.
  - Step 3: Deploy backend to Heroku.
  - Step 4: Set up MongoDB Atlas for database hosting.

# 9. **User Documentation**
Provide guidance for end-users on how to interact with your software. Include installation steps, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

**Example:**
- **Installation:**
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Run npm install to install dependencies.
  3. Set up environment variables (.env file).
  4. Run npm start to launch the application.
- **Usage:**
    - Create Task: Click the "Create Task" button and fill in the required fields.
    - Mark Task as Completed: Check the box next to a task to mark it as completed.

# 10. **Maintenance plan**

# 11. **Conclusion**
Summarize the goals achieved by the project and its impact. Discuss any challenges faced during development and areas for improvement in future iterations.

**Example:**
  - Challenges: Integration of Firebase Auth was difficult due to conflicting dependencies.
  - Future Improvements: Add email reminders for tasks and implement dark mode.
