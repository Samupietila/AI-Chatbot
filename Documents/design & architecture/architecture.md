3. System Overview
3.1 Architecture Style
The system uses a modular layered architecture, comprising:

1.Frontend Layer: User interface for interaction.
2.Backend Layer: Handles business logic, NLP processing, and integrations.
3.Data Layer: Manages model training data, logs, and configurations.

3.2 Core Technologies
*Programming Languages: Python (core logic and model development).
*Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/PyTorch for NLP model training and inference.
*Web Framework: Flask/FastAPI for API endpoints and serving the chatbot.
*Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing user data, training logs, and configurations.
*Deployment Tools: Docker for containerized deployment.
